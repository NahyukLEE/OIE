# OIEID: Outdoor-Illumination-Estimation from Intrinsic Decomposition

A research project(for my B.S. Thesis) on outdoor illumination estimating methods.


## Installation
This repository will be developed and tested on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**.
- Detail environments will be updated(CUDA, Python, PyTorch etc.)

### Environment Setup
- TBU: I will provide our setup script, soon.

(Optional) One may need to modify CUDA path and Anaconda path in the "setup.sh" script. \
One can setup the environment by running the script as follows:
```
bash setup.sh oie
conda activate oie
```

## Dataset Creation
You can see detail instructions for dataset creation(using Blender) in this [MD](./docs/DATA.md).
